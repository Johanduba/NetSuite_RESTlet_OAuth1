This python script calls a NetSuite RESTlet using OAuth1.0.  
The code is based on reading a file of JSON data and then calling the main procedure.  
The main procedure calls the logic to correctly construct the signature without using any OAuth libraries.
Creating the parameter string and headers was the most difficult part of the process.
